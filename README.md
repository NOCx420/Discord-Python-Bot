# Discord-Python-Bot

You might ask yourself why I don't have moderation commands or have a seperate file for commands. It's because that's still too hard for me to do, I will continue this bot for sure, but I have reached a satisfactory point. Altough it will never have as many features as other big bots at least i's my own. ;)

The Packages you'll need to run this bot are:  
  -discord  
  -os  
  -numpy  
  -dotenv  
  -asyncio
